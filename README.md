# Elec01 Turbidity Monitoring System

This repository contains the complete firmware and software for the **ENG5105 Final Design Project**  
conducted by *Team Elec01 ‚Äì Electrical Engineering Discipline, Monash University (2025)*.

The project demonstrates a compact **turbidity-monitoring system** that integrates an STM32L432KC
microcontroller with a Raspberry Pi 4 web-based dashboard for real-time water-quality monitoring.

## üåä Overview

High turbidity in wastewater accelerates membrane fouling and increases energy and maintenance costs.
Our system provides continuous optical turbidity measurement using an **850 nm infrared LED and BPW34
photodiode** pair. The analog signal is conditioned by a **transimpedance amplifier (LM358)**, digitised by
the STM32‚Äôs **12-bit ADC**, and streamed to the Raspberry Pi for visualization, data logging, and alarm handling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture
The complete architecture is described in the *Final Design Report* (Section 6.0 & 9.0).

**Description**
A lightweight **web-based GUI** built with **FastAPI** and **HTML5 Canvas** allows real-time visualization,
threshold configuration, alarm logging, and data export.
**Run on Raspberry Pi**
```bash
cd gui
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn server:app --reload
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000  (or http://<pi-ip>:8000)
